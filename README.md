# render.com blueprint to deploy Alby Hub with phoenixd

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/getAlby/hub-phoneixd-render-blueprint)

One-click deploy Alby Hub with phoenixd to [render.com](https://render.com/)

In case you want to further customize your installation copy the render.yaml file and make adjustments. 
By default this deployment uses a fixed http-password for phoenixd, this is not a problem because the phoenixd is only internally available.
